## NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. Here are some key features and benefits of using NumPy:

### Key Features
- **Multidimensional Arrays**: Efficient storage and manipulation of large arrays and matrices.
- **Mathematical Functions**: Extensive library of mathematical functions for element-wise and matrix operations.
- **Broadcasting**: Perform operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit loops.
- **Linear Algebra**: Support for linear algebra operations, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.
- **Performance**: Optimized for performance with underlying C and Fortran code, making it much faster than native Python lists for large datasets.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with other scientific libraries such as SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
